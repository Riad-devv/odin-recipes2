Hi there...

This new project is going to be about some recipes, I would like to make a complete recipe list of easy to-do quick breakfasts, lunch and dinners for someone who has some stomach and health problems, in my case, I can eat most of the list of available foods in the market but also I had some restrictions and this list wouuld be a good idea as reminder and as ideas for myself!
